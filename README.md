# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project uses machine learning models to predict customer churn in a telecom dataset. The goal is to identify patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to leave the service.

## Dataset
The Telco Customer Churn dataset includes customer demographics, service usage, billing information, and churn labels.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Run cells sequentially from top to bottom

## Results
Ensemble-based models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) outperform Logistic Regression in terms of predictive performance.

## Notes
This project is for educational purposes and demonstrates a basic churn prediction workflow.
